I knew going into this project that I wanted to do a project comparing living costs and tax burden based on discussion I had had with my spouse after seeing a tax burden dataset online. The hardest part was limiting the scope of the dataset because there are so many factors that can go into calculating affordability. I had been struggling to find MSA or CBSA level data before the Thanksgiving deadline with no avail. I ended up seeking feedback from a peer outside of the class who I knew had worked a lot with housing and real estate data. Based on that feedback I finally it was better for consistency and the scope of this project to just stick to state level data. That feedback really made the difference in figuring out the direction for my projects.
